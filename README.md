# Flappy Bird
I'm just having fun with p5 while learning about Machine Learning. Use and modify the code as you want, just
keep in mind everything is probably wrong as _I have no idea what I am doing_.

If you really want to learn about Processing & p5 (visualisation, making games, ...) or the concepts behind Machine Learning, I kindly recommend you to follow [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/) instead. You can grab the assets I've used [from here](https://www.spriters-resource.com/mobile/flappybird/sheet/59894/).

I've did this Flappy Bird clone about a year ago and adapted the code to implement a Perceptron, poor's man Genetics and any new crazy thing I've watched on Shiffman's YouTube channel.

Please feel free to open issues and pull requests.
